Repository with talks and exercises of our Efficient GPU Programming for Exascale tutorial, last held at [ISC22](https://app.swapcard.com/widget/event/isc-high-performance-2022/planning/UGxhbm5pbmdfODYxMTQ2).

## Coordinates

* Date: 29 May 2022
* Occasion: ISC22 Tutorial
* Tutors: Andreas Herten (JSC), Markus Hrywniak (NVIDIA), Jiri Kraus (NVIDIA), Lena Oden (Uni Hagen) (and Simon Garcia (BSC), helping from afar)

## Setup

The tutorial is an interactive tutorial with introducing lectures and practical exercises to apply knowledge. The exercises have been derived from the Jacobi solver implementations available in [NVIDIA/multi-gpu-programming-models](https://github.com/NVIDIA/multi-gpu-programming-models).
